        <h3>- Profiles now clickable (with a menu! (buttons don't work yet))
            <br>- Caps lock notification will now show up when typing in your account information (on sign in)
            <br>- You can now @{username} people, and it will glow yellow and play a little sound
            <br>- You can no longer have alt accounts

            <h3> - Chat should no longer lag as much when they're many people on at the same time
                <br>- The filter should no longer censor everything that has some profanity in it (example: grass, brass, glass, etc.)
                <br>- Fixed message stacking
                <br>- Stopped uploads when user is muted
                <br>- Mention sounds (@{username}) do not play on page load
                <br>- Older message will automatically be cleared after 100 new messages (improves lag)
